summary: A contributed conference poster about first generalisations in PROCESS for generic stellarators
abstract: "Stellarators are attractive candidates for a fusion power plant owing to their inherent steady-state capability and absence of disruptions, albeit being challenging to design and build. The recent start of operation of the prototype advanced stellarator Wendelstein 7-X has shown that such configurations can be achieved with great engineering accuracy, which provides further incentive to study fusion power plant designs with a stellarator core.

In this context, fast, macroscopic and holistic design studies are indispensable to explore the various different stellarator configuration and optimization regions that the 3-D stellarator geometry allows. A part of these studies is the identification and modeling of specific engineering constraints, like material limitations and its impact on crucial configuration parameters such as the device size, which has implications on the total cost. It is due to the sheer variety of different configurations and the reduced symmetry that stellarator design studies are particularly high dimensional compared to tokamak studies and thus require more involved models.

A convenient way to study different designs is by applying so called systems codes, which aspire to model an entire fusion power plant within a single framework. Previous work embedded a branch for the Helical-Axis-Advanced-Stellarator (HELIAS) concept into the tokamak systems code PROCESS [1,2]. Up to now, PROCESS is limited to model 5-fold symmetric HELIAS configurations. A generalization to arbitrary stellarator concepts is thus still open.

Here, I present stellarator-specific modules for the systems code PROCESS to enlarge the possible configuration space, focusing on a modular coil model, a geometry model and a bootstrap current model. In these models, effective values like the maximum magnetic field on the coils are extracted in a variable way by external calculations, incorporating the full coil geometry, and are then fitted for device specific models that can be used in a systems code. In case of the modular coils an external calculation using a Biot-Savart routine was done, the geometry model uses VMEC data and the bootstrap current model was fitted using neoclassical transport calculations (DKES and NTSS).

One goal and subject to future work will be a framework in PROCESS, using these implemented models, to allow design studies of compact tokamak-stellarator hybrids with significant bootstrap current [3].
