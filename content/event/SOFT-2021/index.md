location: Virtual

summary: A contributed poster presentiation presenting results from general stellerator modelling within PROCESS.
abstract: "Stellarators are promising candidates for a DEMO power plant. Albeit challenging to design and build, stellarators provide relevant advantages compared to tokamaks when it comes to reactor viability: They are not prone to current driven disruptions, can run in steady state, and are not dependent on an external current drive.
A convenient way to study different power plant designs is by applying systems codes, which aspire to model an entire fusion power plant within a single framework. 
Previous works [1] have implemented a stellarator version of the systems code PROCESS. This version however was limited to one stellarator design, was dependent on an engineering study and had a limited set of design parameters.
In this work, we present an enhanced version of this implementation, where we enlarge the applicable class of stellarators and also increase the design parameter space. Each stellarator configuration is now preprocessed and a finite set of effective parameters is calculated, which is then used in scaling laws and fit models within PROCESS. As in tokamak-PROCESS, it is now also possible for stellarators to optimize the winding pack parameters and scale the magnetic field and major radius while fulfilling coil distances and blanket constraints. Furthermore, the modifications increase the performance of the stellarator version of PROCESS by two orders of magnitude.
As application of the new stellarator-PROCESS we show a comparative study of stellarators with different aspect ratios. For this, we use HELIAS type fusion reactors with different field periods as described in [2].
