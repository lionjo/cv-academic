abstract: We present modifications of the fusion reactor systems code PROCESS that allow for a description of a general class of stellarator power plants, based on a stellarator coil-set and the
respective MHD plasma equilibrium. For this, we modify PROCESS such that each stellarator configuration enters the systems code via a set of effective parameters which can be calculated in advance before using them in new scaling models in PROCESS. Further, we show two applications of the new PROCESS version: firstly, we apply the code to three reactor-size stellarator devices with different aspect ratios, and secondly, to three coil-sets optimized for the same equilibrium with varying coil numbers.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
