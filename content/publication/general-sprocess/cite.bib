	title = {A general stellarator version of the systems code {PROCESS}},
	abstract = {We present modifications of the fusion reactor systems code Process that allow for a description of a general class of stellarator power plants, based on a stellarator coil-set and the respective MHD plasma equilibrium. For this, we modify Process such that each stellarator configuration enters the systems code via a set of effective parameters which can be calculated in advance before using them in new scaling models in Process. Further, we show two applications of the new Process version: firstly, we apply the code to three reactor-size stellarator devices with different aspect ratios, and secondly, to three coil-sets optimized for the same equilibrium with varying coil numbers.}
